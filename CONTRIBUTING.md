## Introduction

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!. All types of contributions are encouraged and valued.

## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/Pezmc/BibLatex-Check/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Provide project and python version

## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/Pezmc/BibLatex-Check/issues
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Provide project and python version

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/Pezmc/BibLatex-Check/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

## Project Setup

So you wanna contribute some code! That's great! This project uses GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions, so [read up on how to fork a GitHub project and file a PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) if you've never done it before.

If you want to go the usual route and run the project locally, though:

* Ensure python 2 or 3 is installed
* [Fork the project](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)

Then in your terminal:

* `cd path/to/your/clone`
* `./biblatex_check.py -b tests/input.bib`

And you should be ready to go!

## Contribute Documentation

Documentation is a super important, critical part of this project. 

Documentation contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even if you're just rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling mistake!

## Contribute Code

We like code commits a lot! They're super handy, and they keep the project going and doing the work it needs to do to be useful to others.

Code contributions of just about any size are acceptable!

The main difference between code contributions and documentation contributions is that contributing code requires inclusion of relevant tests for the code being added or changed. Contributions without accompanying tests will be held off until a test is added, unless the maintainers consider the specific tests to be either impossible, or way too much of a burden for such a contribution.

Please be sure to run the test files using both Python 2.7 and Python 3, more details in the readme.
